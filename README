Welcome to mamomsg ![](mamo.jpg)
==================

The mamomsg library is a fork of [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org).  This fork
exists to facilitate future development of the Scalability Protocols as
first created by Martin Sustrik for nanomsg.  For more details about this
project and why it exists, see below.

This library is a simple high-performance implementation of several 
"scalability protocols". The job of the scalability protocols is to define
how multiple applications communicate to form a single distributed application.

For more info check the web site: http://nanomsg.org
There is also documentation for the SP protocols provided in this repository
under the rfcs/ directory.

Build it
--------

1.  Download the package.
2.  Unpack it.
3.  Go to the root directory of the package.
4.  sh autogen.sh
5.  ./configure
6.  make
7.  make check
8.  sudo make install
9.  On Linux or other platforms which use ld.so for dynamic linking, run 
    ldconfig or equivalent as root to update your systemâ€™s shared library cache.

Build it on Windows
-------------------

1.  Download the package.
2.  Unpack it.
3.  Go to the root directory of the package.
4.  run "cmake ."
5.  Open the nanomsg.sln file using MSVC IDE.
6.  Build the entire solution.
7.  Optionally, build RUN_TESTS project to run the test suite.

Why a Fork?
-----------

However, that project (nanomsg) has been suffering from insufficient
leadership, as its creator's time and interest has moved towards other things.
Meanwhile, there is a need to continue to improve the implementation, and
the specifications both.  The mamomsg project is a place for us to do that.
It is hoped that at some point this project and nanomsg may remerge.

Why mamomsg?
------------

The mamo is a now-extinct group of birds that were endemic to Hawai'i. It
is the hope of this project that by taking care of the code base, we can
ensure that it flourishes and does not also become extinct like the mamo.
